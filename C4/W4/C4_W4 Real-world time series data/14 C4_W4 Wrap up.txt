Wrap up


The next screencasts will show how you can use different network architectures to predict real world data.

Congratulations on getting this far! In this course, you've dipped your toe into the water of understanding sequences and some of the tools for predicting them! Hopefully, it was a fun journey and we're really looking forward to what you build next! :)
