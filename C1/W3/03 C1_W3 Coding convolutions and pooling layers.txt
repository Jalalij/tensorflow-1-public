Coding convolutions and pooling layers


The concepts introduced in this video are available as Conv2D layers and MaxPooling2D layers in TensorFlow. 
https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Conv2D
https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/MaxPool2D


Youâ€™ll learn how to implement them in code in the next video.
