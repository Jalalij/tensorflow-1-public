Try it for yourself (Lab 1)


Here is the notebook that Laurence was using in that screencast.

If you're running this in Colab, the GPU runtime has already been pre-selected for you to make the training run faster.

Work through it, and try some of the exercises at the bottom. It's really worth spending a bit of time on these because, as before, they'll really help you by seeing the impact of small changes to various parameters in the code. You should spend at least 1 hour on this today!

Once youâ€™re done, go onto the next video and take a look at some code to build a convolution yourself to visualize how it works!
