Here is the notebook to try some convolutions.

Let us know if you come up with any interesting filters of your own! 

As before, spend a little time playing with this notebook. 
Try different filters, and research different filter types. 
There's some fun information about them here. https://lodev.org/cgtutor/filtering.html
