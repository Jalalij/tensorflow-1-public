Training the neural network


Now that you’ve learned how to download and process the horses and humans dataset, you’re ready to train. When you defined the model, you saw that you were using a new loss function called ‘Binary Crossentropy’ (https://gombru.github.io/2018/05/23/cross_entropy_loss/), and a new optimizer (http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tijmen/csc321/slides/lecture_slides_lec6.pdf) called RMSProp (https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/optimizers/RMSprop).
