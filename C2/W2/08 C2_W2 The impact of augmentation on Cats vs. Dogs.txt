The impact of augmentation on Cats vs. Dogs

Now that we’ve seen it overfitting, let’s next look at how, with a simple code modification, we can add data augmentation to the same Convolutional Neural Network to see how it gives us better training data that overfits less. 
The notebook used in the next video will still be the one you just used in the previous screencast.
