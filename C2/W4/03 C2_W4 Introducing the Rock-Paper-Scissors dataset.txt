Introducing the Rock-Paper-Scissors dataset




Rock Paper Scissors is a dataset, https://laurencemoroney.com/datasets.html, containing 2,892 images of diverse hands in Rock/Paper/Scissors poses. It is licensed CC By 2.0 and available for all purposes, but its intent is primarily for learning and research.

Rock Paper Scissors contains images from a variety of different hands,  from different races, ages, and genders, posed into Rock / Paper or Scissors and labeled as such. 
You can download the training set here (https://storage.googleapis.com/laurencemoroney-blog.appspot.com/rps.zip), and the test set here (https://storage.googleapis.com/laurencemoroney-blog.appspot.com/rps-test-set.zip). 
These images have all been generated using CGI techniques as an experiment in determining if a CGI-based dataset can be used for classification against real images. I also generated a few images that you can use for predictions. You can find them here (https://storage.googleapis.com/laurencemoroney-blog.appspot.com/rps-validation.zip).

Note that all of this data is posed against a white background.

Each image is 300Ã—300 pixels in 24-bit color


You'll see how this dataset can be used to build a multi-class classifier in the next video.
